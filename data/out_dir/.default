This is the default instance.
In order to create a new instance, do as follows:

First create a user config file as per your preferences:

	lt -mucf <user_config_file_name>

Then create a new instance,

	lt -i <instance_name> -uc <user_config_file_name> -n

Where,
  -i  : Tells the filename
  -uc : Tells the user config file you want to use.
        User confg file are just settings to deal with the file.
  -n  : Tells to copy boilerplate code to the instance.
